# Example Transcript

Just listened to Naval's podcast for a little bit more. I don't know how much how much more time I just spent listening to him. But I kind of got back and he was talking a little bit about some foundational values that he holds. For example, things like honesty, radical honesty, not putting himself in environments where he can't be honest or he needs to watch what he says because if he has to watch it  says he has to either think about what he's gonna say, or think about what he said in the past. And in that case, she's not being you know, being able to live in the present, which is one of his core philosophies staying in the present. So I think that was pretty interesting. Also, he said, one of the main things He cast out was anger and then specifically jealousy. And he said, he said he put jealousy a really interesting way, which is, there's no way that you can be jealous unless you want everything the other person has. So you can't just cherry pick people's values and qualities. You can't just pick how good looking they are. The money they have. You have to take everything including their life goals, your partner, their lifestyle, and everything else. And I think that was a really good way of looking at things a little bit differently because it makes you take into perspective. Jealousy can be pretty few tops. And also, he's just been saying that like, he doesn't really take notes, because there's there's no real point because he never really looked back on those notes. So it's an interesting way of looking at things and maybe I'll keep rough notes, but I won't go into too much depth

# Example Response

1/7: 🎧 Deep dive into @Naval's podcast today. Some key takeaways? Radical honesty & living in the present. If you're always watching what you say, you're either stuck in the past or future, not fully in the now. #NavalRavikant #Mindfulness

3/7: 😡🚫 Naval also spoke about eliminating anger and especially jealousy from his life. This resonated with me - negativity only holds us back from reaching our full potential. #Positivity #SelfImprovement

4/7: 🍒 The perspective on jealousy was particularly enlightening. You can't cherry-pick someone else's traits or successes without accepting their entire life - goals, lifestyle, partner and all. It's a holistic package. #Jealousy #LifeLessons

5/7: 💡 This insight can revolutionize how we view jealousy. It's a futile emotion when we realize we can't selectively covet aspects of someone's life. It's all or nothing. #MindsetChange

6/7: 📝 Naval also mentioned he doesn't take notes as he rarely revisits them. It's an interesting approach. Maybe instead of detailed notes, I'll keep rough outlines to jog my memory without overloading with details. #NoteTaking
