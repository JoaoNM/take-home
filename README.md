# take-home
Objective: The goal of this take-home assignment is to assess your skills in backend development using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. You are expected to build a simple API for an application that takes a transcript as input, creates a tweet thread using ChatGPT, and allows users to save their generated tweet threads. Please complete the assignment within 2-3 days.

Assignment:

1.  Set up a new Node.js project using Express.
    
2.  Integrate MongoDB as the database for storing user accounts and saved tweet threads.
    
3.  Implement a simple user authentication system with signup and login functionality.
    
4.  Create database schemas for "User" and "TweetThread" models. A User should have the following attributes:
    
    -   email (String, required, unique)
    -   password (String, required)
    -   savedTweetThreads (Array of TweetThread references)
    
    A TweetThread should have the following attributes:
    
    -   user (User reference, required)
    -   transcript (String, required)
    -   tweets (Array of Strings, required)
    -   createdAt (Date, autogenerated)
    -   updatedAt (Date, autogenerated)
5.  Integrate the OpenAI API to generate a tweet thread from a given transcript using ChatGPT.
    
6.  Implement the following API endpoints:
    
    a. POST /auth/signup - Register a new user: - Validate the incoming data (email and password). - Store the new user in the database. - Return a success message as a response.
    
    b. POST /auth/login - Authenticate a user: - Validate the incoming data (email and password). - Return a success message and a JSON Web Token (JWT) for authenticated requests.
    
    c. POST /tweet-threads - Create a new tweet thread: - Authenticate the user using the provided JWT. - Validate the incoming transcript data. - Use the ChatGPT API to generate a tweet thread from the transcript. - Store the tweet thread in the database. - Return the generated tweet thread as a response.
    
    d. GET /tweet-threads - Retrieve all saved tweet threads for the authenticated user: - Authenticate the user using the provided JWT. - Fetch the user's saved tweet threads from the database. - Return the tweet threads as a response.
    
7.  Write tests for the API endpoints using a testing library of your choice (e.g., Mocha, Jest, etc.).
    

Submission:

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Include a README.md file in the repository with instructions on how to run the project and tests.
3.  Share the link to the GitHub repository with us.

Evaluation Criteria:

We will evaluate your assignment based on the following:

1.  Code quality, organization, and readability.
2.  Proper implementation of API endpoints.
3.  Proper handling of errors and edge cases.
4.  Use of best practices for Node.js and Express.
5.  Proper implementation of database schema and operations.
6.  Adequate test coverage for the API endpoints.

Good luck! We're looking forward to reviewing your submission.
